    <p>GhostBlade is a fantasy comic series that takes place in another world named Neraland. 
        The series is set in an older age without any firearms or modern technology. 
        The main protagonists of the series are GhostBlade, Yan, Kain, Mars, and Lenia. 
        The series started in 2014 with Chapter 0 (Intro): Heaven Eye and is still ongoing for 2020 newest release, Chapter 10: Lone Wolf.
        I will update this through my spare time.
